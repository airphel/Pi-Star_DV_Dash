**BIG FAT WARNING**
===

This, and other required Pi-Star modules, are my personal forks, **DO NOT** report bugs, request features or anything like that, to the official **Pi-Star** developer, **Andy Taylor** (MW0MWZ), on the Pi-Star's Facebook page or on the forum.

***

**How to install it**
===

Two possible options are:
  - Prepare an SDCard using the disk image available [here](https://tny.sh/PiStar-V4-RMB).
  - An **easy** manual installation, over a pristine running Pi-Star system, following the below procedure:

	 * you need a working Pi-Star, from [here](http://www.pistar.uk/downloads/). Only Pi-Star v4.1.x are supported.

	 * **MAKE A BACKUP OF YOUR Pi-Star CONFIGURATION**
	 * connect your Pi-Star
	 ```shell
	 ssh pi-star@pi-star.local
	 ```
	 * grab the script that permits you to toggle between official repositories and my personnal ones.
	 ```shell
	 sudo su
	 rpi-rw
	 cd
	 wget http://tinyurl.com/f1rmb-pistar-ng -O f1rmb-pistar
	 chmod +x f1rmb-pistar
	 ```
	 * now you can execute this script with some arguments. For a complete list, use '-h' or '--help'
	 The easiest way:
		 * to install these forks repositories:
		 ```shell
		 ./f1rmb-pistar -ia
		 ```
		 * to switch back to the official ones:
		 ```shell
		 ./f1rmb-pistar -ra
		 ```

	 ***

	 1. Once you have installed this fork, you need to go in menu "**Configuration**" -> "**Expert**" -> "**Tools**" and select "**CSS Tool**" 
	 This will reset all the colors to their default value.
	 2. You will need to launch "pistar-upgrade" multiple times, until it displays the "**You are already running the latest version..**" message.

 **What features this fork offers**

 * An enhanced POCSAG support. A service and network status indicators are there, You can send pages from the **Admin** web page. When you receive personnal pages, they are extracted from the **Activity** and displayed in a dedicated table.
